As part of the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program at UCI, I received a grant for my research with Dr. Krone-Martins on ML emulators for cosmology. In addition to writing a grant proposal, students who receive the grant must also give either an oral presentation or a poster presentation. The oral presentation requires an audition and is a selective process. I was one of ten finalists whose auditions were accepted and who presented on Wednesday for the theme "Innovations."
