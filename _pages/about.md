Hi! My name is Omar Yahia. I'm a computer science graduate student pursuing a Master of Science at the [University of California, San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/graduate/degree-programs/ms-program). I earned my Bachelors degree in Computer Science at [University of California, Irvine](https://ics.uci.edu/), graduating magna cum laude with a GPA of 3.974 with both [ICS](https://ics.uci.edu/honors/) and [Campuswide](https://honors.uci.edu/) Honors. I am currently pursuing research in agentic AI, dimension reduction techniques, and LLM efficiency.

My professional experience includes working as an intern at a [Columbia NLP Lab](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~zhouyu/) and the [Arklex.AI](https://www.arklex.ai/) startup, where I assisted in research on LLM e-commerce systems for [Walmart Global Tech](https://www.walmart.com/cp/sparky/5291783).
